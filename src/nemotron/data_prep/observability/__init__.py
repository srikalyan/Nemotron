"""Observability utilities for data preparation pipelines.

This package provides consolidated access to observability features:
- W&B integration for real-time pipeline metrics
- Stage naming conventions

W&B Integration:
    The WandbStatsHook is the primary observability mechanism used by recipes.
    It patches PipelineMonitor to intercept stats and log to W&B in real-time.

    >>> from nemotron.data_prep.observability import make_wandb_stats_hook
    >>> hook = make_wandb_stats_hook(observability=cfg, pipeline_kind="pretrain")
    >>> with hook:
    ...     pipelines_v1.run_pipeline(spec)
