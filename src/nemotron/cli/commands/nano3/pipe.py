"""Pipeline command: compose pretrain + sft into a single nemo-run Experiment.

Requires --run or --batch (remote execution only). Each stage resolves
its own config from its own [tool.runspec] metadata, so the pipe command
only needs pipeline-level options (profile, mode, dry-run).

RL uses Ray and cannot compose with nemo-run Experiments -- run it separately.
